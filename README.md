# BCC202-TP01
This project implements and analyzes cellular automata in C. Cellular automata simulate complex systems with grids of cells evolving through rules. The focus is on one-dimensional (Rule 110) and two-dimensional (Conway's Game of Life) automata, demonstrating recursion, dynamic memory allocation, and data structure manipulation.
